# EasyLink

EasyLink is a C++ software development kit for developing MEX-functions 
for MATLAB and blocks for SIMULINK (S-functions).

EasyLink allows to develop C++ MEX-functions and S-functions with less code and
using friendly classes.

EasyLink is simpler and as efficient than the MATLAB C API. It provides a
direct access to input, output and parameter ports as well as MATLAB
variables thanks to a C++ Array class or using Eigen.

EasyLink is a multi-platform library that works under Linux, OSX and Windows.

EasyLink is developed and maintained within the FEMTO-ST Institute located in Besan√ßon, France and hosted by Renater and Github.

# Installation

  - Clone ar download EasyLink in a local directory
  - Open MATLAB
  - Set the matlab current directory where EasyLink is located
  - Execute the startup file "install.m" and follow
     instructions to select an installed C++ compiler
`>>install`
  - Execute the following command to compile and link a demo file
`>>make sfunOffset.cpp`
  - Open Simulink
  - Open the file "testOffset.mdl/slx" and run it to check the installation

Use the file sfunOffset.cpp as a template to write a new S-function (SIMULINK).

Use the file mexArrayProduct.cpp as a template to write a new MEX-function (MATLAB).
