\mainpage Overview

You need to write efficient MATLAB functions or SIMULINK blocks?

You hate the MATLAB C API? You do not like the code produced by the S-function
generator either?

You would like to use C++ and to write classes? 

EasyLink is for you!!!

### Description

EasyLink is a C++ software development kit for developing MEX-functions 
for MATLAB and blocks for SIMULINK (S-functions).

EasyLink allows to develop C++ MEX-functions and S-functions with less code and
using friendly classes.

EasyLink is simpler and as efficient than the MATLAB C API. It provides a
direct access to input, output and parameter ports as well as MATLAB
variables thanks to a C++ Array class or using Eigen.

EasyLink is a multi-platform library that works under Linux, OSX and Windows.

### Download

The latest release can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/gjlaurent/easylink">
here</a>.

Use Git or checkout with SVN using the web URL:

\verbatim https://github.com/gjlaurent/easylink.git \endverbatim

### Installation

  -# Clone ar download EasyLink in a local directory
  -# Open MATLAB
  -# Set the matlab current directory where EasyLink is located
  -# Execute the startup file "install.m" and follow
     instructions to select an installed C++ compiler
\verbatim >>install \endverbatim
  -# Execute the following command to compile and link a demo file
\verbatim >>make sfunOffset.cpp \endverbatim
  -# Open Simulink
  -# Open the file "testOffset.mdl/slx" and run it to check the installation

Use the file sfunOffset.cpp as a template to write a new S-function (SIMULINK).

Use the file mexArrayProduct.cpp as a template to write a new MEX-function (MATLAB).

### Input port methods

\code{.cpp}
    double input0=getInputScalar(0);
    Array<double>  input1=getInputArray<double>(1);
\endcode

### Output port methods

\code{.cpp}
    setOutputScalar(0,output0);
    Array<double> output1=getOutputArray<double>(1);
\endcode

### Parameter port methods

\code{.cpp}
    int parameter0 = getParameterScalar(0);
    double parameter1 = getParameterScalar(1);
    std::string parameter2 = getParameterString(2);
    Array<double> parameter3 = getParameterArray<double>(3);
\endcode

### Arrays

\code{.cpp}
    if (existMatlabArray("test")) ...

    Array<double> test = newMatlabArray(2, 2, "test");
    test(0, 0) = 2;
    test(1, 1) = 4;

    Array<double> test2 = getMatlabArray("test2");
    test2 += 1;
    test2.print();

    Array<double> a(2, 2, "A");
    a(0, 0) = -3;
    a(1, 1) = 4;
    a.print();
\endcode


\page pageExamples Examples

S-function basic example (use it as a template to write new S-functions):

  - sfunOffset.cpp shows how to write a S-function that adds a scalar value
    to a scalar input.

S-function examples that demonstrate all the features:

  - sfunInputs.cpp shows all the different ways to use the input ports.

  - sfunOutputs.cpp shows all the different ways to use the output ports.

  - sfunParameters.cpp shows all the different ways to use the parameters ports.

  - sfunMatlabArrays.cpp shows all the different ways to use the matlab arrays.

S-function advanced examples:

  - sfunSizeChange.cpp shows how to change the size of an output according
    to the value of a parameter.

  - sfunTimesTwo.cpp show how to change the size of an output according to
    the size of a dynamically-sized input array.

S-function examples using Eigen:

  - sfunTimesTwoWithEigen.cpp same as sfunTimesTwo.cpp but using Eigen in place 
    of built-in Array class.

  - sfunStateSpace.cpp shows how to write S-functions with continuous states
    and Eigen.

MEX-function basic example (use it as a template to write new MEX-functions):

  - mexArrayProduct.cpp shows how to write a MEX-function that multiplies
    a matrix and a scalar.

MEX-function example using Eigen:

  - mexArrayProductWithEigen.cpp same as mexArrayProduct.cpp but using Eigen 
    in place of built-in Array class.
